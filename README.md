# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

    • Building Tic Tac Toe text-based Game, when you are only allowed to use takes it might be harder than using a GUI regarding the limitation and restraints by only using string, but the best part is that emojis are a string type also which had considerably simplified the placing of "❌" and "⭕" instead of using "X" and "O" which will be difficult to differentiate.
    • The hardest part was to structure the grid, finding a way to position the emojis in place, figuring when all locations are occupied, and know the winning combination of the emojis index.
    • The logical improvement is to make a GUI for this game to provide a better user experience and interaction.
